# Hi, welcome to your first Ruby file.

# To run this file, inside your Terminal, type: ruby 00-puts_and_methods.rb
# You can do that for all the files in this directory.

# Everything starting with a "#", like this line, is a comment, it doesn't do anything.
# It's just for you to leave notes to yourself - like this.  
#
# Talking about commenting in comments, that's meta.

# The main way to get Ruby to output code is either through the method: puts
# puts stands for "PUT String (to screen)" 

puts("Hello, world.")

# Notice that we have ()'s around the string "Hello, world."
# Ruby let's us ignore them as well - so we can just type:

puts "Hello, world - I'm naked and without my ()s"

# Exercise 1: Just "puts" more stuff to the screen (add code to this file and keep running it)
